## Submitting changes

Please send a [Pull Request to TornTools](https://github.com/Mephiles/torntools_extension/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should contain more information about the changes.
